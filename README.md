# Python Scripts Collection

A collection of individual Python scripts designed for various utility tasks, automation, or specific functionalities.

## Description

This repository serves as a central place to store and manage miscellaneous Python scripts that I've developed. Each script is intended to be self-contained or have minimal, clearly defined dependencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è General Setup & Prerequisites

Before running any of these scripts, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Python:** Most scripts are developed with Python 3.8+ in mind. Check individual script notes for specific version requirements if any.
    *   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  **Pip (Python Package Installer):** Usually comes with Python.
3.  **Dependencies:**
    *   Some scripts might have external library dependencies. These will be listed under each script's section.
    *   If a `requirements.txt` file is present in the root of this repository, you can install all common dependencies by running:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Otherwise, install dependencies for individual scripts as needed:
        ```bash
        pip install <package_name>
        ```
